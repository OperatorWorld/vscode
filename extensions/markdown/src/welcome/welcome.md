## Welcome to Visual Studio Code

A lightweight yet powerful source code editor for Windows, Mac and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of [extensions](command:workbench.extensions.action.showPopularExtensions) for other languages (such as C++, C#, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes.

Pick your favorite [color theme](command:workbench.action.selectTheme) and [keymap](command:workbench.extensions.action.showRecommendedKeymapExtensions) and consult our [keyboard reference](command:workbench.action.keybindingsReference) to get started.
You can always get filterable list of [all commands](command:workbench.action.showCommands) (⇧⌘P). Replace the leading `>` there with a `?` to see other useful quick access features.

### IntelliSense

Visual Studio Code comes with powerful IntelliSense for JavaScript and TypeScript preinstalled. Other languages can be upgraded with better IntelliSense through one of the many [extensions](command:workbench.extensions.action.showPopularExtensions).
